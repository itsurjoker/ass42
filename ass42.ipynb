    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables (in this case, the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores), you would need a dataset containing paired values for these two variables. Let's denote the amount of time as \"X\" and the exam scores as \"Y.\" The formula to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (often denoted as \"r\") is as follows:\n",

    "r=n∑(XY)−∑X∑Y/(n∑X2−(∑X)2)(n∑Y2−(∑Y)2)\n",

    "    ∑∑ denotes the sum of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After calculating rr, its value will be between -1 and 1. Here's how to interpret the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "    r=1r=1: There is a perfect positive linear correlation between the two variables. This means that as the amount of time spent studying increases, the exam scores also increase proportionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.7≤r<10.7≤r<1: There is a strong positive linear correlation between the two variables. This suggests that there's a significant tendency for higher exam scores as study time increases, though the relationship might not be perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.3≤r<0.70.3≤r<0.7: There is a moderate positive linear correlation between the two variables. This implies that an increase in study time is associated with a moderate increase in exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "    0<r<0.30<r<0.3: There is a weak positive linear correlation between the two variables. This suggests that there's some positive relationship between study time and exam scores, but it's not very strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "    r=0r=0: There is no linear correlation between the variables. Study time and exam scores are not related in a linear fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    −0.3<r≤0−0.3<r≤0: There is a weak negative linear correlation between the two variables. This means that higher study time is associated with slightly lower exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "    −0.7<r≤−0.3−0.7<r≤−0.3: There is a moderate negative linear correlation between the two variables. An increase in study time is linked to a moderate decrease in exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "    −1≤r≤−0.7−1≤r≤−0.7: There is a strong negative linear correlation between the two variables. Higher study time is connected to lower exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
